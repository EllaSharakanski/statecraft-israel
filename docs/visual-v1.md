# Visual v1: measurements, budgets and checkpoints

Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-11-statecraft-visual-v1.md`. Promo targets: `promo/final/03-gameplay-1936.png`,
`promo/final/02-map-diorama.png`. Poses: `PromoPose.Gameplay03` (34.86 E, 32.00 N, 60 km, yaw 10) and
`PromoPose.Diorama02` (35.05 E, 31.55 N, 250 km, yaw 0).

## How to measure
- Frame time: `?vprofile` (WebGL) or `-vprofile` (desktop player, quits when done), always under
  `uv run tools/machine_lock.py --exclusive --wait-unity -- ...` (no other Unity job on the machine). Per pose, every
  configuration (`all`, each toggle off alone as `-<name>`, `none`) runs 3 times in interleaved orders, 300 frames after
  60 warm-up frames (and, before the first pose, one discarded warm-up pass of every configuration); Chrome runs with
  `--disable-frame-rate-limit --disable-gpu-vsync` and the anti-throttling flags (`--disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows
  --disable-renderer-backgrounding --disable-background-timer-throttling`), headless through `web_check.py` (add
  `--stall 120`), headed through `headed.py profile`. Both fix the page's viewport to exactly 1920x1080 CSS pixels at the
  DPR over CDP (`Emulation.setDeviceMetricsOverride`, before the page loads), so headed and headless runs draw the same
  pixels even when the laptop screen clamps the headed window (its final composite is then scaled; the backbuffer is not).
  Every line states `res=` and the render `scale=`, and both tools FAIL on a `res=` other than 1920x1080 times the DPR
  (and on a stall: no console line for 120 s). Read the `PROFILE summary` lines: a feature costs
  `median(all) - median(-name)`. The WebGL frame clock is quantised to about 1 ms: averages are fine, but every p95 is a
  whole millisecond, so a p95 budget is only good to about 1 ms.
- Boot: `uv run tools/headed.py boot --runs 3 [--baseline MS] [--baseline-first-frame MS] [--cpu R]` (three cold loads in
  a kept-awake headed window with a 1920x1080 viewport). Two spans, each the median of the runs: `map_build_ms`
  (heightmap decoded to map built) and `first_frame_ms` (navigation start to the second animation frame after `GAME OK`:
  download, scene load and texture uploads, map build and the first draw with its shader compiles). `--cpu 4` adds CPU
  throttling as a cheap low-end proxy; every line states `cpu=`.
- Headed frame time: `uv run tools/headed.py profile --dpr 1` (`--dpr 2` is the fill-rate stress proxy). `--wait-unity`
  also waits for an interactive Unity editor that has any worktree open (it holds `unity/Temp/UnityLockfile`): close it,
  or the profile waits.
- Screenshots: `tools/art_checkpoint.sh [--no-build] <name>` (WebGL `?shot` + editor renders of both tiers + side-by-side
  images and their deuteranopia/protanopia copies under `captures/visual/<name>/`, git-ignored; rows in the main
  checkout's `captures/visual/art-log.tsv` with the branch, short commit and the image's absolute path). It refuses to run
  while `QualitySettings.asset` (and, when it builds, `unity/Assets/Settings` or `ProjectSettings.asset`) has unstaged
  changes, restores them on every exit, and takes the pose list from `PromoPose.cs`. Each checkpoint switches the
  worktree's build target WebGL -> OSXUniversal (editor renders) and back at the next build, a reimport each way: budget
  a few minutes per checkpoint.

## Budgets (proposed; ratified in Task 10)
Measured on the development Mac (Apple silicon, integrated GPU), 1920x1080 at DPR 1, Chrome for Testing:
- headless, all features on: median p95 <= 16.7 ms at both poses, and median(all) - median(none) <= 8 ms;
- each feature: median(all) - median(-feature) <= 2.5 ms (tilt-shift <= 1.5 ms, labels <= 1 ms); a cost counts as over only
  when it exceeds the budget plus the larger of the two spreads;
- headed numbers are recorded, plus a DPR-2 headed run in Task 10 as a fill-rate stress proxy for weaker GPUs; the 30 fps
  floor for an integrated-GPU laptop (research notes 2.3) is 33 ms p95;
- boot: each span (`map_build_ms` and `first_frame_ms`, median of 3, at `--cpu 1` and at `--cpu 4`) grows by at most
  max(300 ms, 50% of its Task 1 baseline): the tool's default when `--budget` is not given (controller ruling 3).

## Baseline (Task 1, before any visual change; re-recorded in fix round 1)
Viewport fixed to 1920x1080 at DPR 1 over CDP; Chrome kept awake; build from `0b6058e` (harness only).

| boot, `--cpu 4` | `BOOT map_build_ms median=1813 runs=3 cpu=4`<br>`BOOT first_frame_ms median=6963 runs=3 cpu=4` |

Boot budgets from these (ruling 3, baseline + max(300 ms, 50%)): `--cpu 1` map build 443 -> 743 ms, first frame
3547 -> 5321 ms; `--cpu 4` map build 1813 -> 2720 ms, first frame 6963 -> 10445 ms.

Notes:
- The headed window is clamped by the laptop screen (1728 px wide); the emulated 1920x1080 viewport still gives a
  1920x1080 backbuffer (`res=1920x1080`), only the final composite to the window is scaled.
- No toggles exist yet, so `all` and `none` are the same scene: their difference and the spreads are the noise floor.
  Headless spreads are 0.05-0.17 ms; headed gameplay03 is noisier (spreads 0.57-0.76 ms, `all` vs `none` 0.48 ms apart).
- Superseded first recording (commit `33fb072`, before the CDP viewport): headless ran at `res=1920x937` and headed at
  `res=1728x860`, with a first-pose spread of 0.68 ms (headless) and one headed run that stalled; do not compare with it.

## Baked textures (Task 5)
`tools/terrain_bake.py` regenerates `unity/Assets/Textures/Map/terrain_bake.png` and `coast.png` from the committed
heightmap in about 10 s. The output is deterministic per toolchain: re-running it with the pinned numpy 2.5.3 and
pillow 12.3.0 on the same machine gives byte-identical PNGs. Another platform may differ in its zlib build or in
1-ulp `sin`/`arctan` results. Compare decoded pixels (`np.array_equal`), not file bytes; R and B may then differ by
one level here and there.

## Task 6: terrain
The Statecraft Terrain Lit Shader Graph (`tools/terrain_graph.py` + `StatecraftTerrain.hlsl`): one terrain layer (one
pass) instead of seven, no basemap fallback. WebGL build (`-compression disabled`): `BUILD Succeeded WebGL ->
Builds/Web-disabled: 73.4 MB on disk, 0 errors` (Task 1: 70.9 MB; +2.5 MB, the two baked textures), no `Shader error`.
GLES3 check: `ShaderChecks.Gles3Errors` is empty for `Statecraft/StatecraftTerrain` (no `#extension ... : require`;
`AllowedRequires` not needed).

Against the Task 1 baseline (`all`): gameplay03 2.29 -> 1.58 ms, diorama02 6.84 -> 7.25 ms (+0.41 ms, inside 2.5 ms plus
the spread). Haze costs nothing measurable (`all` - `-haze`: -0.30 / +0.12 ms, both inside the spreads). The boot phase
`biome texture baked` takes 94-106 ms (it replaces Task 1's `biome colours blended`).
