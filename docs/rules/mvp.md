# Rules of the GDD v0.1 MVP

The rules of the 1948–1951 MVP in [docs/GDD.md](../GDD.md), as Phase 1 builds them behind the `systems.loop` switch
([the approved plan](../superpowers/specs/2026-10-12-gdd-v0.1-impact-and-plan.md), §6). Balance values are the owner's.
Until the owner sets them, they are placeholders marked `# PLACEHOLDER: owner sets` in `content/`.

## Turns

R-TURN-001: The turn length on each security rung (1 to 5) is read from the rules key `turn_lengths` of the era the turn starts in. Without the key it is quarter, quarter, quarter, month, week, today's table. The GDD's monthly turns set all five to month.
